This is my homepage generator and Common Lisp exploration.
It uses some SBCL-specific features. To run it

Usage
=====

```
sbcl --script make.lisp <source-files>
```

In additional parameters pass all text files to process.

Input format
=============

Program accept MD-like syntax, but mostly on surface. Way to
separate paragraphs, code and headers are the same. Currently
there is only one way to mark header and if header is on the
beginning of a document it's page title rather than section
header.

You can use `%` to make %italics%, there are special forms
to make table of contents and embed audio:

```
!!TOC: TOC title

!!AUDIO: foo.mp3
```
